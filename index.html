                    <p class="hero-second">Dylan thought he was safe from the chopping block. That was until I got on the game and showed him how a real idiot does this. His website is actually more creative than this one, but just the fact that he didn't make it, makes this site infently better than anything that he can produce (Even though he can easily beat me in a fist fight, and is 5 feet taller than me. I'm 6'2" btw.) Click the sign up button if you would like to see a IRL 1v1 with me and Dylan.</p>

Across the ring from you, you see Dylan, his muscles bulging as he warms up. He's the reigning champion, and he's defended his title for years. But you've come too far to back down now.</p>
